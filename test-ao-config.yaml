      Always run tests before pushing.

      Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, refactor:, test:).

      Link issue numbers in commit messages.

      Write clear commit messages that explain WHY, not just WHAT.


      Use modern JavaScript (ES6+).

      Prefer const over let, never use var.

      Use async/await over raw Promises.

      Use template literals for string interpolation.


      This is a pnpm monorepo with workspaces.

      Run commands from root with pnpm -r (recursive) or from specific package
      directories.

      Before pushing: pnpm build && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test.

      Always build packages before running dependent packages.


      Before pushing, run these commands:

      - pnpm build (build all packages)

      - pnpm typecheck (type check all packages)

      - pnpm lint (or pnpm lint:fix to auto-fix)
