      Always run tests before pushing.

      Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, refactor:, test:).

      Link issue numbers in commit messages.

      Write clear commit messages that explain WHY, not just WHAT.


      Use TypeScript strict mode.

      Use ESM modules with .js extensions in imports (e.g., import { foo } from
      "./bar.js").

      Use node: prefix for built-in modules (e.g., import { readFile } from
      "node:fs").

      Prefer const over let, never use var.

      Use type imports for type-only imports: import type { Foo } from
      "./bar.js".

      No any types - use unknown with type guards instead.


      This is a pnpm monorepo with workspaces.

      Run commands from root with pnpm -r (recursive) or from specific package
      directories.

      Before pushing: pnpm build && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test.

      Always build packages before running dependent packages.


      Before pushing, run these commands:

      - pnpm build (build all packages)

      - pnpm typecheck (type check all packages)

      - pnpm lint (or pnpm lint:fix to auto-fix)
